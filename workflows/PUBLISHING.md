## Prerequisites

Before publishing a workflow, ensure you have:

1. **Valid Workflow**: A working `workflow.yml` that passes `specify workflow run` validation
2. **Git Repository**: Workflow hosted on GitHub (or other public git hosting)
3. **Documentation**: README.md with description, inputs, and step graph
4. **License**: Open source license file (MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.)
5. **Versioning**: Semantic versioning in the `workflow.version` field
6. **Testing**: Workflow tested on real projects

---

## Prepare Your Workflow

### 1. Workflow Structure

Host your workflow in a repository with this structure:

```text
your-workflow/
├── workflow.yml               # Required: Workflow definition
├── README.md                  # Required: Documentation
├── LICENSE                    # Required: License file
└── CHANGELOG.md               # Recommended: Version history
```

### 2. workflow.yml Validation

Verify your definition is valid:

```yaml
schema_version: "1.0"

workflow:
  id: "your-workflow"              # Unique lowercase-hyphenated ID
  name: "Your Workflow Name"       # Human-readable name
  version: "1.0.0"                 # Semantic version
  author: "Your Name or Organization"
  description: "Brief description (one sentence)"
  integration: claude              # Default integration (optional)
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"         # Default model (optional)

requires:
  speckit_version: ">=0.6.1"
  integrations:
    any: ["claude", "gemini"]      # At least one required

inputs:
  feature_name:
    type: string
    required: true
    prompt: "Feature name"
  scope:
    type: string
    default: "full"
    enum: ["full", "backend-only", "frontend-only"]

steps:
  - id: specify
    command: speckit.specify
    input:
      args: "{{ inputs.feature_name }}"

  - id: review
    type: gate
    message: "Review the output."
    options: [approve, reject]
    on_reject: abort
```

**Validation Checklist**:

- ✅ `id` is lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens (single-character IDs are allowed)
- ✅ `version` follows semantic versioning (X.Y.Z)
- ✅ `description` is concise
- ✅ All step IDs are unique
- ✅ Step types are valid: `command`, `prompt`, `shell`, `gate`, `if`, `switch`, `while`, `do-while`, `fan-out`, `fan-in`
- ✅ Required fields present per step type (e.g., `condition` for `if`, `expression` for `switch`)
- ✅ Input types are valid: `string`, `number`, `boolean`
- ✅ Step IDs do not contain `:` (reserved for engine-generated nested IDs like `parentId:childId`)

### 3. Test Locally

```bash
# Run with required inputs
specify workflow run ./workflow.yml --input feature_name="user-auth"

# Check validation
specify workflow info ./workflow.yml

# Resume after a gate pause
specify workflow resume <run_id>

# Check run status
specify workflow status <run_id>
```

### 4. Create GitHub Release

Create a GitHub release for your workflow version:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The raw YAML URL will be:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-org/spec-kit-workflow-your-workflow/v1.0.0/workflow.yml
```

### 5. Test Installation from URL

```bash
specify workflow add your-workflow
# (once published to catalog)
```

---

## Submit to Catalog

### Understanding the Catalogs

Spec Kit uses a dual-catalog system:

- **`catalog.json`** — Official, verified workflows (install allowed by default)
- **`catalog.community.json`** — Community-contributed workflows (discovery only by default)

All community workflows should be submitted to `catalog.community.json`.

### 1. Fork the spec-kit Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/spec-kit.git
cd spec-kit
```

### 2. Add Workflow to Community Catalog

Edit `workflows/catalog.community.json` and add your workflow.

> **⚠️ Entries must be sorted alphabetically by workflow ID.** Insert your workflow in the correct position within the `"workflows"` object.

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "updated_at": "2026-04-10T00:00:00Z",
  "catalog_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/spec-kit/main/workflows/catalog.community.json",
  "workflows": {
    "your-workflow": {
      "id": "your-workflow",
      "name": "Your Workflow Name",
      "description": "Brief description of what your workflow automates",
      "author": "Your Name",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-org/spec-kit-workflow-your-workflow/v1.0.0/workflow.yml",
      "repository": "https://github.com/your-org/spec-kit-workflow-your-workflow",
      "license": "MIT",
      "requires": {
        "speckit_version": ">=0.15.0"
      },
      "tags": [
        "category",
        "automation"
      ],
      "created_at": "2026-04-10T00:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2026-04-10T00:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Submit Pull Request

```bash
git checkout -b add-your-workflow
git add workflows/catalog.community.json
git commit -m "Add your-workflow to community catalog

- Workflow ID: your-workflow
- Version: 1.0.0
- Author: Your Name
- Description: Brief description
"
git push origin add-your-workflow
```

## Verification Process

After submission, maintainers will review:

1. **Definition validation** — valid `workflow.yml`, correct schema
2. **Step correctness** — all step types used correctly, no dangling references
3. **Input design** — clear prompts, sensible defaults and enums
4. **Security** — no malicious shell commands, safe operations
5. **Documentation** — clear README explaining what the workflow does and when to use it

Once verified, the workflow appears in `specify workflow search`.

---

## Release Workflow

When releasing a new version:

1. Update `version` in `workflow.yml`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Tag and push: `git tag v1.1.0 && git push origin v1.1.0`
4. Submit PR to update `version` and `url` in `workflows/catalog.community.json`

---

## Best Practices

### Step Design

- **Use gates at decision points** — place `gate` steps after each major output so users can review before proceeding
- **Keep steps focused** — each step should do one thing; prefer more steps over complex single steps
- **Provide clear gate messages** — explain what to review and what approve/reject means

### Inputs

- **Use descriptive prompts** — the `prompt` field is shown to users when running the workflow
- **Set sensible defaults** — optional inputs should have defaults that work for the common case
- **Constrain with enums** — when there's a fixed set of valid values, use `enum` for validation
- **Type appropriately** — use `number` for counts, `boolean` for flags, `string` for names

### Shell Steps

- **Avoid destructive commands** — don't delete files or directories without explicit confirmation via a gate
- **Quote variables** — use proper quoting in shell commands to handle spaces
- **Check exit codes** — shell step failures stop the workflow; make sure commands are robust

### Integration Flexibility

- **Set `integration` at workflow level** — use the `workflow.integration` field as the default
- **Allow per-step overrides** — let individual steps specify a different integration if needed
- **Document required integrations** — list which integrations must be installed in `requires.integrations`

### Expression References

- **Only reference prior steps** — expressions like `{{ steps.plan.output.file }}` only work if `plan` ran before the current step
- **Use `default` filter** — `{{ val | default('fallback') }}` prevents failures from missing values
- **Keep expressions simple** — complex logic should be in shell steps, not expressions
